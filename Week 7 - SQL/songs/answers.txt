1. Characterize the audio aura
   To characterize a listener's audio aura using their top 100 songs,
   I would analyze the average values of these attributes:

   - Danceability
     How suitable a track is for dancing, where higher values indicate a track is more danceable.
   - Energy
     The intensity and activity level of the track, where higher energy suggests a more dynamic sound.
   - Valence
     The mood conveyed by the track, where higher values mean the music sounds more positive or happy,
     and lower values more sad or negative.
   - Tempo
     The speed (BPM) of the song, contributing to the pacing of the music.
   - Loudness
     Overall volume level, which could imply how "intense" or soft the songs are.

   For each attribute, an average value is obtained. These values will give a quantitative sense
   of the listener's musical habits, which can then be used to describe their "aura" in terms of:
   - High energy/danceability/tempo: Could imply an energetic and outgoing personality.
   - Low valence: A preference for darker or more emotional music.

   Example:
   - Danceability = 0.7 (highly danceable)
   - Energy = 0.8 (high energy)
   - Valence = 0.4 (darker or moody)
   - Tempo = 120 BPM (moderate)
   - Loudness = -5 dBFS (quite loud)

   This could correspond to an aura of "Energetic yet Moody" or "High Energy but Dark."


2. Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
   - Music variability
     Averages might smooth out the natural variation in the listener’s preferences.
     Someone might enjoy both upbeat dance tracks and melancholic ballads, but averaging
     these together doesn’t capture the emotional diversity in their taste.

   - Contextual Listening
     People listen to different types of music based on mood, season, or activity (e.g., gym, studying),
     so a single aura based on averages doesn't account for these shifts.

   - Limited Range of Attributes
     Energy, valence, and danceability only capture part of the musical experience.
     Factors like genre, lyrics, and cultural context, which are deeply personal, aren’t considered.

   Better Ways of Calculating the Aura:

   - Clustering Music Preferences
     Instead of averaging, you could cluster songs into categories based on their attributes
     (e.g., energetic/danceable vs. mellow/low-energy). This would allow the aura to reflect
     different "moods" or "vibes" within the listener’s playlist, giving a more nuanced picture.

   - Weighting by Play Count
     Give more weight to songs that the listener played more often. This would ensure that
     their most frequently listened tracks have a stronger influence on the aura.

   - Time-Segmented Aura
     Create multiple auras based on different time periods (e.g., morning vs. night listening habits, or seasonal patterns).
     This could show how the listener’s musical mood shifts over time.

   - Incorporating Lyrics/Genre
     If you had access to additional metadata like lyrical content or genre, you could build
     a more comprehensive emotional profile that considers not only how the music sounds but also what it communicates.

   - Dynamic Contextual Aura
     Spotify could analyze the context in which the music was played (e.g., work, relaxation, party),
     adapting the aura to these different contexts, rather than creating a single, averaged aura.

   By improving the calculation, the aura would better reflect the diversity and richness of the listener’s musical experiences.
