sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: For sorted files, sort1 was the fastest in sorting them
                  and it was the slowest sorting program in both a random
                  number text file, as well as a reversed text file.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: For a reversed and random files, it was exponentially
                  faster compared to the other sorting programes.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: For a sorted files, it was the slowest sorting program
                  in sorted text file. Hence we can conclude that
                  this is selection sort
